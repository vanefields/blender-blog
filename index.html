          <h1>Blender - A Free Software for 3D Artists</h1>
          <p>In the world of 3D art, there are many software choices for artists to pick from. ZBrush, Autodesk Maya, and SketchUp are some noteworthy choices. Another popular option is Blender. Released in 2002 by the Blender Foundation, the software allows modeling, animating, rendering, and much more. One of the Blender Foundation's goals from their own website is:</p>
          <blockquote cite="https://www.blender.org/about/foundation/">
            <p>Provide individual artists and small teams with a complete, free and open source 3D creation pipeline.</p>

              <h3>Blender's Rendering Capabilities</h3>
              <p>There are two render engines in Blender: Eevee and Cycles. Eevee is a real-time render engine that works lightly on your computer's system resources. NPR (Non-photorealistic rendering) shaders are commonly created in the Eevee engine. You can achieve cartoon or hand-drawn looks with your models. On the other hand, Cycles provides more photorealistic renders called PBR shaders that utilize a powerful computer system.</p>

              <h3>Sculpting in Blender</h3>
              <p>Other than modeling by connecting polygons, Blender provides artists with a full sculpting workspace. Built-in brushes such as Smooth, Clay, Draw, and more are readily available after installing Blender. Rather than only affecting the shape of a mesh, Blender allows sculpting with dynamic topology that allows details to be quickly added and removed. Masking areas to isolate parts of a mesh is another important feature added by the Blender team.</p>
